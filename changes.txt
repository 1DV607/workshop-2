We got feedback about not using the correct UML notation for the class diagram 
since we had not used association arrows in the diagram but only dependency and 
realization.

Change Log:
• Adds association arrows to class diagram.

We also got feedback that our model was highly coupled because of the use of 
the MemberNode and BoatNode classes and that a better solution might be to 
simply have each member contain a list of boats. We thought this was good 
feedback but we decided not to change this now because it would take a lot of 
time, but it's something we will take with us in the future while designing.
